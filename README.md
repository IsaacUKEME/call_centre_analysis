# Data Insights:
1. Day of Week Analysis
Peak Call Volume on Friday: Friday recorded the highest call volume (5,570), surpassing Sunday (the lowest at 4,296) by 29.66%, indicating potential end-of-week customer urgency or operational trends.

Weekday Variability: Total calls across days ranged from 4,296 (Sunday) to 5,570 (Friday), suggesting moderate fluctuations in demand.

2. Channel Performance
Call-Center Dominance:

Call-Center handled 10,639 calls, 61.79% higher than Web (6,576), reflecting a strong preference for voice support.

Contributed 32.30% of total call volume, outperforming Chatbot, Email, and Web.

Channel Disparity: Call volume across channels spanned 6,576 (Web) to 10,639 (Call-Center), highlighting uneven customer engagement by channel.

3. Inquiry Type Breakdown
Billing Questions Drive Volume:

Billing inquiries dominated at 23,462 calls, representing 71.22% of total volume.

Outpaced Payments (4,749) and Service Outage (4,730) by 5x, signaling potential billing process or communication issues.

4. Geographic Distribution
Top Cities:

Washington led with 1,110 calls (3.37% of total), followed by Houston and New York City.

Long-Tail Distribution: Across 461 cities, call volume ranged from 7 to 1,110, indicating highly fragmented demand with most cities contributing minimally.

Actionable Recommendations
Investigate Billing Query Surge: Audit billing processes, FAQs, or customer education materials to reduce repetitive inquiries.

Optimize Channel Resources: Allocate more staff to Call-Center during peak days (e.g., Fridays) and improve self-service options for Web/Chatbot.

Regional Focus: Prioritize support for high-volume cities (e.g., Washington) while analyzing low-volume regions for potential service gaps.

Sunday Low Volume: Explore root causes for reduced Sunday activity (e.g., limited hours, customer preferences) to align staffing.
